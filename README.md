# Automatic Print mode
The default Automatic Painting mode for RoboPaint

![Print Mode Example](images/print_preview_3.jpg?raw=true)

This module is a mode for [RoboPaint](https://github.com/evil-mad/robopaint),
the software for drawing robots, and your
[friendly painting robot kit, the WaterColorBot](http://watercolorbot.com)!

This is the default, end user, easy peasy, no fuss Automatic Printing mode
for taking and SVG and putting it out to the robot. The biggest emphasis for
this mode should always be an uncluttered, easy to understand and use interface
in any language.
